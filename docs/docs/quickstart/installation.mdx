# Installation

```bash
# install peer dependencies if not already in your project
npm install @solana/spl-token @solana/web3.js

npm install @audius/fetch-nft
```

:::tip Mismatched dependencies

Recent changes to the Solana [spl-token library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@solana/spl-token-registry) are not currently compatible with Fetch-NFT.

While a fix is in the works, run the `npm install` command with pinned version `0.1.8` like this.

```bash
npm install @solana/spl-token@^0.1.8 @solana/web3.js
```
