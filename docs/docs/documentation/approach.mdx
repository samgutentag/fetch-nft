# Developer Facing Documentation

<details><summary>Prompt</summary>

Spend some time thinking about and laying out how you would want the documentation for Fetch-NFT to evolve and let us know how & why.

The surface area of this library is not huge, so lean into that and show us what you can do.

</details>

## Primary Goal:

Educate developers using Fetch-NFT on best practices, the intended use cases, and common stumbling points

## Continuous Improvement:

Monitor support channels, especially GitHub issues to keep documentation up to date and address new use cases developers are creating.

## Audius Onramp:

Fetch-NFT and other libraries have intrinsic value in themselves, but also serve as an onramp to the broader Audius SDK and other utilities

Focusing on high quality documentation and regular updates builds trust in the developer ecosystem for other Audius libraries and SDKs
