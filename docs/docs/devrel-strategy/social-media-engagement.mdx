# Social Media Engagement

## Engagement:

- Maintain an active presence on social media platforms like Twitter, Telegram, Discord and Reddit
- Actively respond and engage with developers from official channels
- Share Fetch-NFT news and other “projects of interest” to broaden the reach
- Tap adjacent and growing web3 communities to co-host content and raise awareness across the developer space

## Content Creation:

- Create and curate blog posts, video tutorials and demos, written tutorials to address common developer challenges and workflows
- Share best practices and common workflows for developers just getting started which can progress across the SDKs
- Leverage existing developer community by hosting showcases and demo sessions for builders using Fetch-NFT and the Audius SDK
