# Developer Relations Strategy

<details><summary>Prompt</summary>

## **Create a plan & strategy for how we will engage with the developer community**

We would like to see you put on your planning cap and think ahead strategically towards how we can achieve the high-level goals of Fetch-NFT. At a minimum, this should include:

- Consideration on events, workshops, social pushes, etc.
- Budgets for any the above
- Strategy around data collection
- Plan for sourcing feedback on the product and providing support

</details>

**Identify Developer Community:**

Developer experiences should revolve around Developers. Maintaining a "Meet them where they are" mindset will foster trust, understanding, and empathy for developers working with Fetch-NFT and the Audius SDK.

**Promote Usage Of Audius:**

Libraries like Fetch-NFT build trust in the Audius team and can inspire developers to dig further into other offerings. We want developers to think "Does Audius have anything for this?" when they hit roadblocks in their app journeys.

**Social Media Engagement:**

Developers are out there, and the web3 ecosystem is active in many places online. Maintaining a social media presence that is engaged with users and actively responding to and advocating for other ecosystem players helps build awareness for Fetch-NFT and Audius.

**Organizing Events And Workshops:**

Online and in-person events are a great way to raise awareness and build communities. Audius is uniquely positioned to reach a wide audience given the Audio and Music focus. But don't stop there! Hackathons, competitions, game jams, and workshops for developers working across the web3 and web2 ecosystem will create onramps for developers to discover and understand the benefits of Fetch-NFT and Audius.

**Feedback And Support:**

Core development should not happen in a vacuum, and developers working on the Audius SDK should have a voice to provide feedback and make suggestions. Every developer has a use case, many of them are unique, and developer relations is the place to synthesize and organize feedback for the betterment of all.

**Data Collection:**

A "you can’t manage what you can’t measure" mantra should drive decisions in developer support and relations efforts. Knowing and understanding the issues developers working with Fetch-NFT and Audius are facing guides documentation, tutorials, and other support content creation. Not to mention the added benefits for product and engineering teams within Audius that come from understanding use cases.

**Budget:**

Gotta spend money to make the devs happy. While not the most exciting, budgeting and planning to make the best use of company resources is paramount. Optimizing content pushes and developer interaction opportunities while staying good stewards of Audius resources is crucial for the long-term success of Audius as a whole.
