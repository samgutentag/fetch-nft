# Promote Usage of Audius

> text goes here

- Small, direct, useful utilities like Fetch-NFT can be used to grow an existing community of developers to think “lets see if Audius has solved this”
- Onramp to larger SDK
- Keep developers coming back for more
- Create a Developer inspired roadmap for new features and integrations across the Audius platform and ecosystem.
- Embracing Hedgehog’s “build DApps for the other 99%” mantra
