# Promote Usage of Audius

Small, direct, useful libraries like Fetch-NFT inspire an existing community of developers to ask: “lets see if Audius has solved this” when working on their own apps. This mentality creates an onramp from small libraries to the larger Audius SDK.

Working with existing developers and embracing Hedgehog’s “build DApps for the other 99%” mantra inspires a developer driven roadmap for new features and integrations across the Audius platform and ecosystem.
