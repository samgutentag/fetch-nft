# Identify the Developer Community

Understanding the needs, motivations and interests of the developer community is key to formulating a DevRel strategy to build a community of developers using Fetch-NFT and other Audius SDKs
To start, developers working with Fetch-NFT can be segmented to 2 use groups

## Blockchain Devs:

Use Fetch-NFT to access information cross-chain, inspiring Audius as a “go to” for useful utilities for the web3 ecosystem at large

## App Devs:

Already integrate Audius Content into their own Apps and dApps, and can use Fetch-NFT to access Collectibles without needing to fully dive into web3
