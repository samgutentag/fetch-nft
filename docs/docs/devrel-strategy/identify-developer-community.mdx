# Engage With Developer Community

<details><summary>Prompt</summary>

## **Create a plan & strategy for how we will engage with the developer community**

We would like to see you put on your planning cap and think ahead strategically towards how we can achieve the high-level goals of Fetch-NFT. At a minimum, this should include:

- Consideration on events, workshops, social pushes, etc.
- Budgets for any the above
- Strategy around data collection
- Plan for sourcing feedback on the product and providing support

</details>

Understanding the needs, motivations and interests of the developer community is key to formulating a DevRel strategy to build a community of developers using Fetch-NFT and other Audius SDKs
To start, developers working with Fetch-NFT can be segmented to 2 use groups

## Blockchain Devs:

Use Fetch-NFT to access information cross-chain, inspiring Audius as a “go to” for useful utilities for the web3 ecosystem at large

## App Devs:

Already integrate Audius Content into their own Apps and dApps, and can use Fetch-NFT to access Collectibles without needing to fully dive into web3
